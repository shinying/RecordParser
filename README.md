# Video Record Parser for NTU COOL

Scripts for parsing raw video records downloaded from NTU COOL (usually `video_analytics.csv`) and calculating averge completion rate weighted by video durations.

## Environment

- python 3+
- numpy
- pandas

## Parsing raw records

```bash
python get_view_prog.py -i [raw data] -o [path for saving records] -d [path for saving duration]
```

## Calculating completion rate

As raw records are acculmulated since the first video, you can open the record csv generated at the previous step, and delete the useless columns. The columns kept in the generated records will all be used for calculating averge completion rate.

```shell
python get_score.py -w [records generated by the previous step] -o [path for saving result]
```
